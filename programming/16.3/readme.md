# Homework
Based on setTimeout function, implement the following functionality.
1. create a Dummy application page - with header "Welcome to your Bank"
2. create another login page - with only simple form ( username, password, button login)
3. when the user is in the application page - if the user is not moving his mouse for 5 min the application will popup a sweet alert with a message "you are about to disconnect" after 10 sec if the user is not clicking anything he will redirected to the login.
4. instead of 5 min put 10-20 sec for the development mode, so it will be more easy to develop it.
